### Introduction

```i2p``` (Invisible Internet Project) is an anonymous network layer. You can visit websites builed on it or visit public internet. And here I will introduce how to use i2p.

### How to install i2p

I will just describe how to install i2p on linux. Because I never use i2p on windows. One reason is that ```Windows``` is not safe enough. And it's more convient to configure ```i2p``` on linux.

There are two implementations of i2p client. 

```i2p```(Written in Java). User-friendly Web-GUI and more features like built-in client of email.

```i2pd```(Written in C++). A light-weight client. Consume less memory and CPU.
