1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,939
接下来这段就是我要在此视频要去制作的

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,939
video

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:17,940
[音频]

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:19,890
Hello, 我是 InspirAspir

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,330
在我们开始前

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,029
我想介绍一下

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,060
我的第一张EP "Dreamland"

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,189
在十一月三日发行

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,050
我相信在这个视频一周后

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,550
就会发布

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,550
如果你喜欢并支持我的工作

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,899
可以去听一听

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,390
这个视频会教你如何在 Ableton Live 10 中

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,309
制作你的第一首歌

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,890
我曾在 Live 9 做过类似的事

16
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,720
但未免有些过时

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,850
所以我想花些时间

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,860
带着一些新发现

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,260
来重新制作这个视频

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,060
来教你如何从零开始制作一首歌

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,000
ground rules for myself I will only be 
并遵守

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,579
using default Ableton plugins just the
只使用 Live 自带插件

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,710
stock instruments audio effects that
和自带乐器和效果

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,720
没有三方插件

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,670
我将尽量使用 Live 10 中

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,439
相较于 Live 9

27
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,020
更新的乐器与效果

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,579
这样我就可以

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,680
让这个视频稍加不同

30
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,240
并更加现代

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,370
废话不多说

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,240
我们开始制作我们的第一首歌

33
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,520
你可以看到一个新的 Live 会话

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,290
在我的面前

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,380
这是创建一个新的 Live 会话是

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,540
默认的界面布局

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,760
我按下我的 Tab 键

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,409
来调整我的排列视图

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,870
现在你可以看到总共两条 MIDI 轨道

40
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,580
和两条音频轨道

41
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,170
MIDI 轨道是我们

42
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,970
要编写乐器需要演奏的音符的地方

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,040
音频轨道将

44
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,200
会被用于加载采样

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,240
首先我想设置这首歌的 BPM

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,950
现在只是一个粗略的估计

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,260
并可以随时根据自己喜好

48
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,930
来修改它

49
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,490
feeling maybe something around 80 bpm
现在我想让 BPM 在 80 左右

50
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,869
the lower the number the slower the song
BPM 越低， 曲速越慢

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,150
the higher the number the faster next I
BPM 越高， 曲速越快

52
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,009
want to start by making some chords this
我想从写和弦开始

53
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,479
is just a personal preference I like to
这是一个个人偏好

54
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,370
start with the chords and build from
我喜欢先写和弦

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,709
there to make some chords I first need
然后从那些和弦构建整首歌曲

56
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,200
to make a MIDI clip to do this I'm going
现在我要创建一个 MIDI 片段

57
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,870
to left click and drag for however long
我需要左键和拖拽

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,239
I want within a MIDI track in this case
我想要的 MIDI 轨道的长度

59
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,980
this is 17 bars long to make the MIDI
这样, 就有了 17 格

60
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,290
clip I'm gonna right click on my
现在右键我选中的

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,050
highlighted area and select insert MIDI
区域然后选 "Insert MIDI(插入 MIDI 片段)"

62
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,150
clip you
你

63
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,280
see this piano roll pop up if you don't
会看到这个钢琴卷弹出， 如果没有

64
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,560
be sure to double-click your MIDI clip
双击你的 MIDI 片段

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,270
from here I can click right about here
从这里我可以右键

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,240
my cursor will make this symbol which
我的光标会变成这样

67
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,400
allows me to click and drag upwards to
然后就可以点击然后向上拖动

68
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,140
expand the piano roll I can press the B
钢琴卷就会变大, 

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,970
button on my keyboard to switch to the

70
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,800
draw mode you'll see this pencil pop up

71
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,220
and I can draw in some notes but if I

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,360
hit play the spacebar nothing happens

73
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,520
that's because I don't have any

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,650
instrument assigned so what I need to do

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,330
is go over into my Ableton library and

76
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,120
pick an instrument to do this I'm gonna

77
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,460
go under instruments and select my

78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,650
instrument under these drop-down menus a

79
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,560
new instrument - Ableton Live 10

80
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,880
specifically is the wave table so let's

81
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,380
pretend I want to use the wave table

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,530
instrument to do that I'm going to

83
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,240
left-click and drag and drop onto my

84
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,250
MIDI track I'm gonna go back into my

85
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,690
piano roll again by double clicking and

86
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,670
now if I hit play quick tip if you want

87
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,520
to hear the sounds of your notes as you

88
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,160
click on them say for example you can do

89
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,840
so by clicking this button right here by

90
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,610
default it's grayed out click it it

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,950
turns blue now every time you draw on a

92
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,420
note you can hear that sound just

93
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,400
something to consider great so at this

94
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,500
point I can now start to make my chords

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,660
writing chords I feel like is out of

96
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,820
scope for this video that's more or less

97
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,920
a topic for another day but for now I'm

98
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,900
just gonna whip up some quick notes just

99
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,580
to get the point across okay so I've

100
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,320
gone ahead and created a chord

101
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,090
progression that I'm happy with for the

102
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,160
sake of this video a few things that I

103
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,800
did was that I just made some chords

104
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,110
they hit every bar so for at the end I

105
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,420
have them hitting every half bar and I

106
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,860
also changed my BPM what I'm trying to

107
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,020
get across here is that nothing's

108
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,820
necessarily locked in stone stay in my

109
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,160
BPM I can change that any time if I'm

110
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,540
not necessarily feeling it also get

111
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,280
creative with your chords you don't

112
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,739
necessarily have to have them hit every

113
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,750
bar you can change up a pattern maybe

114
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,750
have them hit every quarter

115
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,320
maybe you can have them hit in fifths

116
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,940
in fact yeah that's something I kind of

117
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,889
like so I'm gonna keep that so yeah I

118
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,770
made it so that these are fits so now

119
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,030
five chords hit in every bar and then at

120
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,100
the end here I actually changed that

121
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,530
pattern and I did a quarter followed by

122
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,229
needs the takeaway here I think is that

123
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,180
while music theory is important and good

124
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,710
to know also the rhythm is very

125
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,240
important too just because you have

126
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,220
something that sounds nice doesn't mean

127
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,350
it's catchy and potentially vice versa

128
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,000
so this is a chord progression I'm happy

129
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,830
with and for the most part I just want

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,360
this to loop one thing you can do is

131
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,160
you'll notice there's a bar up here I

132
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,260
can click and drag I'm going to move

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,840
this to the left and I'm gonna drag this

134
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,770
right end over to the end and actually

135
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,410
for now I'm just gonna go ahead and

136
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,240
delete this end bit this tail it's not

137
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,070
really needed so one thing I can do is I

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:18,729
can right click this bar and select a

139
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:20,260
loop so now I can press play and you'll

140
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,510
notice that it loops through this MIDI

141
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,800
clip now again here's another thing

142
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,820
that's kind of out of scope of this

143
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,620
video is just straight up sound design

144
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,539
that's kind of a beast in itself so for

145
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,099
the sake of again moving this video

146
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,260
along what I'm gonna do is just use a

147
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,150
preset that I like you can find presets

148
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,400
by going under instruments and then

149
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,080
under any of these subcategories so for

150
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,419
example maybe I like the wave table

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,039
it's new to Ableton Live 10 at which

152
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,580
point I can look for some sounds that I

153
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:54,820
like okay I found a preset that I like

154
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:56,470
under mallets Fizz bells sounds pretty

155
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,870
good to me now let's give our tracks

156
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,409
some bass something to go underneath

157
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,539
these chords to do this I'm gonna go

158
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,760
ahead and copy this MIDI clip and paste

159
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,560
it onto a different MIDI track and now

160
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,240
that we have two layers of our song I'm

161
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,520
gonna go ahead and rename these tracks

162
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,650
just to kind of organize our project a

163
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,240
little bit so over here this Fizz bells

164
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,220
track I just want to rename that I'm

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,500
gonna right-click and select rename I'm

166
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,060
gonna name this flux and then this

167
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,940
number to track the MIDI I'm gonna

168
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,740
rename that to bass and I like to color

169
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,810
these accordingly just again for the

170
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,849
sake of organization right click and I

171
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,990
can select a color and for now I'm

172
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,389
actually just gonna go ahead and delete

173
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,190
these two audio tracks just left click

174
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,529
on them and press the delete button okay

175
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,289
so now on to making our bass I don't

176
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,240
want any

177
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,189
hordes for my base I just want one

178
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,779
single note to play and the note that I

179
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,180
want to play is actually gonna be the

180
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,460
roots of my chords so I'm gonna go into

181
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,409
my base layers MIDI clip and just delete

182
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,539
all of the notes in each chord except

183
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:55,369
for the bottom I just want the last note

184
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,430
on the stack this is the root and

185
00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:00,319
playing this alongside of the chords

186
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,330
should make a sound that I am pretty

187
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:07,159
happy with now I need to assign a bass

188
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:08,749
instrument to my MIDI track I think

189
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:11,080
maybe this one will be good let's try

190
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:11,080
this out

191
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:16,280
so one thing happened there that I'm not

192
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,630
particularly happy with one thing you

193
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,030
should always keep your eye on is the

194
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,490
volume level of your master track the

195
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,470
master track is the overall sound so

196
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,180
what you hear when you press play all of

197
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,370
the layers combined if you look down

198
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,720
here there's a layer called master if I

199
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:34,220
hit play right now there's kind of an

200
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:36,199
issue this went into the red this is

201
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,539
called clipping so basically he went

202
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,099
over the desired threshold and we don't

203
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:42,620
want that some ways to get around

204
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,870
clipping are to adjust the volumes of

205
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,460
your layers or to EQ them accordingly

206
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,560
which we'll get into in just a minute

207
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,080
but the point is I think this base layer

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,759
is just a little bit too loud so I could

209
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,229
either lower the volume of this base

210
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,940
layer or I could look for a different

211
00:07:54,229 --> 00:08:04,310
instrument which I think I'm just gonna

212
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:05,930
do anyways okay so I found a base that I

213
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,940
like but this one actually is more or

214
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,330
less just a sub base this is under

215
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,800
operator base base sine like now this is

216
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,080
defined as a sub base because it only

217
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,280
takes up such low frequencies and I

218
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,570
actually kind of like that so I think

219
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,590
I'm gonna keep it now if you'll notice

220
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:23,030
if I hit play again I'm clipping a

221
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,830
little bit and actually it looks like my

222
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,150
plucks are pretty loud to you so I kind

223
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,949
of want to lower the volume of each of

224
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,479
these tracks and then I'll EQ them so

225
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,280
they fit in later but in order to lower

226
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,620
the volume of your tracks just go over

227
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,899
here where you see this zero click and

228
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,579
drag and you can lower it I'm gonna keep

229
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,349
this to about negative 2 decibels

230
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:40,700
essentially just a little bit quieter

231
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,079
I'm also gonna do the same with my bass

232
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,079
maybe lower just a little bit

233
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,010
I am still clipping but that's okay not

234
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,480
to be worried I'll be sure to clean up

235
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,930
the mix a little bit to make sure that's

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,580
fine

237
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,380
okay so this layer of base covers a lot

238
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,600
of the low end frequencies but now I

239
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,940
also want to cover some of the more

240
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,160
mid-range it's nice to have the rumble

241
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,640
of the sub base but I also want another

242
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,460
layer on top of it so to do that I'm

243
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,400
gonna rename this layer to sub base I'm

244
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:15,070
gonna copy it paste it rename the second

245
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,450
layer to maybe a mid base for this one I

246
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,610
want to find another instrument

247
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,620
something that maybe sounds a little bit

248
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,420
grittier kind of hefty okay this one

249
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,740
sounds kind of good at least for what

250
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,660
I'm trying to do for my own

251
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,980
organization's sake and also for some

252
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,870
other reasons I'll get into it a little

253
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,880
bit I want to group these two together

254
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,770
to do that I'm gonna click right here

255
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,630
hold the shift key and then select my

256
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,270
other MIDI track at which point I can

257
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,370
right click and select group tracks this

258
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,630
creates a group so the two tracks are

259
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,200
now bundled together

260
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,820
I can now rename this to bass now what I

261
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,380
want to do is EQ my layers a little bit

262
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,180
EQ essentially lets me cut off certain

263
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,890
ranges of frequencies that the sound

264
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,000
takes out and if you do it right it can

265
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,280
make your layers fit together like

266
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,220
puzzle pieces to find e queuing we can

267
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,960
go under audio effects and go to EQ I'm

268
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,060
gonna use an EQ 8 for the sake of this

269
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,460
video you can left-click and drag your

270
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,320
audio effects and drop it onto your MIDI

271
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,600
track so this is all my layer of sub

272
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,820
bass and for now I only want to listen

273
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,770
to this track to do that I'm gonna solo

274
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,110
this track by left-clicking right here

275
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:21,130
at this s button now if I hit play I

276
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,150
only hear this track if you look down

277
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,800
here you'll notice that this is the

278
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,810
audio waveform of this track and for the

279
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,580
most part I really only want frequencies

280
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,310
below I don't know something like a

281
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,450
hundred maybe 150 for this sub bass I'm

282
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,790
gonna click one of these drop-down

283
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,640
buttons and select this guy right here

284
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,950
this creates a low-pass filter where I

285
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,360
can set the frequency cutoff range I can

286
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,360
do that by left clicking and dragging

287
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,980
this little circle or by moving this

288
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,830
frequency knob what this says is

289
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,690
anything above 188 Hertz will not be

290
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,760
played it'll just be cut out of the mix

291
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,320
and so I'm gonna do what I said and more

292
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:01,150
or less just go about 100 maybe 120

293
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,620
you can hear the difference if I toggle

294
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,620
this low pass filter on or off

295
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,480
[音频]

296
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,250
you should hear some frequencies being

297
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,870
cut out there when this low-pass filter

298
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,130
is active I'm actually gonna change some

299
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,020
of these notes a little bit by the way

300
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,730
so I raised these notes over here by an

301
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,640
octave because it didn't really sound

302
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,020
good with the sub bass is too low now I

303
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,210
want to do the same thing with my

304
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,430
mid-range bass so I'm gonna solo this

305
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,900
track and add an EQ filter onto it now

306
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,180
I'm going to create a high-pass filter

307
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,550
so the opposite of a low-pass filter

308
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,310
cuts off anything below it I'm gonna set

309
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,530
that at about where my sub bass cuts off

310
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,940
so in this case maybe a hundred and

311
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,130
eleven issue I also want to create

312
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,220
another low-pass filter this time I'm

313
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,960
looking for one maybe around 400 this is

314
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,460
all really subjective it kind of depends

315
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,460
on your specific mix

316
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,980
I'm gonna go ahead and lower the notes

317
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,779
by an octave again do you make our bass

318
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,730
really stand out in this mix I'm

319
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,769
actually gonna put another EQ on our

320
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:10,390
bass group as a whole and then put a

321
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:11,980
low-pass filter at about 400 so just

322
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,930
really make sure that it's cutoff right

323
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,540
there and then I'm going to put an EQ on

324
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,420
our layer of plucks put in a high-pass

325
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,700
filter at that same exact cutoff so it's

326
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,100
more or less saying anything below 400

327
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,420
belongs to our basis anything above

328
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,420
belongs to our plucks

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,030
[音频]

330
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,470
okay so I'm pretty happy with that now

331
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:39,060
let's throw in some drums into the mix

332
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,190
to do this I want to make another MIDI

333
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,620
track I can right click in this empty

334
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,960
space and select insert MIDI track next

335
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm going to go under drums drum rack

336
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,640
and drag that on to that MIDI track I

337
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,740
need to make a MIDI clip and then now if

338
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,350
I left click on this MIDI track you can

339
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,570
see this grid of squares this is where I

340
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,460
can drag in drum kick samples to be

341
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,770
played let's look under Ableton's

342
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:04,650
default drums to see what there is go

343
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:08,240
under drum hits let's go for some kicks

344
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:10,380
and just find a sample that I like I

345
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,450
kind of like this sample but I don't

346
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,400
really like the end of it but that can

347
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,500
be fixed so I'm gonna drag this into our

348
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,960
drum rack and I'm gonna move these start

349
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,250
and end Flags just to the parts that I

350
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,020
want maybe have it fade out a little bit

351
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,700
that sounds nice so now I can go into my

352
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,190
piano roll and you'll notice that my

353
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:33,560
sample is right here so I can draw in a

354
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,560
kick pattern so this is what I drew up

355
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,330
[音频]

356
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,580
some things you can do here to spice up

357
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,950
your drums are to add in some audio

358
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,740
effects onto your kick layer so maybe an

359
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,110
EQ if you go to EQ a drums able to

360
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,550
provide some good default kick each

361
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,600
cueing another thing we can do is

362
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,520
sidechaining this makes the volume of

363
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,740
other tracks dip every time this kick

364
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,899
plays you can do that by going to audio

365
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,209
effects compressor and drag that on to

366
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:09,589
let's say our overall base layer now

367
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,320
you'll see there's a compressor if I

368
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:14,750
select this arrow sidechain and then go

369
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,810
to drum rack let's actually rename that

370
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,940
to kicks now you'll see that it is side

371
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:23,180
change to the kicks I can click this

372
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:27,339
button right here and move this knob to

373
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,339
somewhere around here now if I hit play

374
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,990
our base is being side chained and we

375
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,970
can see that by clicking right here the

376
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:41,390
orange bar represents the volume so

377
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:42,980
every time this kick plays adjusting

378
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,420
this circle right here is a way of

379
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,570
adjusting how much you want it to

380
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:52,490
actually sidechain let's say that's a

381
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,040
good level of ducking what I can do is

382
00:14:52,490 --> 00:15:00,470
copy this compressor and paste it onto

383
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,300
our pluck layer it really makes our

384
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,850
kicks shine it kind of pops through the

385
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,510
mix next let's add in some snares to

386
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:11,120
complement the kicks let's right click

387
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:14,120
insert MIDI track add in a drum rack and

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,900
then find some snares under drums drum

389
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,610
hits and let's go to snares now I

390
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,650
actually found two samples that I like

391
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,260
so let's drag them both into this drum

392
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,060
rack and then make a MIDI clip and let's

393
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,440
draw them both in whenever I want to

394
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,000
snare to play a point is what I'm trying

395
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,680
to say here is you can actually stack

396
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,390
the samples you can play them at any

397
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,730
point maybe even on top of each other

398
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,140
let's rename this two snares and I'm

399
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,570
actually gonna group my kicks and snares

400
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,440
together and call this percussion just

401
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,000
for the sake of organization now the

402
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,350
snares are kind of bland there's some

403
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,880
things you can do to spice them up

404
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,270
including maybe adding in some of the

405
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,270
cueing

406
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,340
which already sounds a little bit better

407
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,320
maybe we can add in things like glue

408
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:03,930
compressor maybe to make it a little bit

409
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:06,030
less harsh knowing your audio effects

410
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,190
and what they do is another element by

411
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,350
itself more or less for the sake of time

412
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,270
let's pretend this is good enough I also

413
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,490
want the other layers of my song to be

414
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,470
sidechain - my snares let's do the same

415
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,870
thing we did for the kicks but this time

416
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,280
a sidechain to our snares layer in fact

417
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,870
let's just copy this compressor and

418
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,850
paste it right next to it it's time

419
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:28,590
switching the side chaining audio from

420
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:33,900
kicks to the snares let's maybe have it

421
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:35,640
duck a little bit more it seems good to

422
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:43,410
me let's copy this paste it on to our

423
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:46,140
plucks at this point you can also add in

424
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:50,190
things maybe like some high hats or some

425
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:52,230
cymbals let's make another MIDI track

426
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,650
with a drum rack on top of it let's find

427
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,300
some high hats I found some high hats I

428
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,040
like at which point I can draw in a

429
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,450
pattern of high hats that I want ok

430
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,450
let's say that's a pattern that I like

431
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:11,840
let's also add in some cymbals I just

432
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,840
made a very simple pattern like this

433
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:18,240
[音频]

434
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,010
seems good to me let's also EQ this one

435
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,400
like we did for the other layers of the

436
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,400
percussion

437
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,600
and maybe adjust the volumes of each

438
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:30,260
element so maybe the high hats are a

439
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,260
little bit too loud

440
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:38,670
maybe these are also a little bit too

441
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:42,080
loud maybe let's also add in some reverb

442
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,080
okay so I'm pretty happy with that

443
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,070
maybe let's also add in another layer of

444
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,840
chords to complement our plucks I'm just

445
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,820
gonna copy and paste what I already have

446
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
for the plucks onto a different MIDI

447
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,770
track let's try and find a different

448
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,330
instrument that we might like for that I

449
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:06,000
found a pad layer that I like under

450
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:14,490
operator pad and glaciar voices I'm

451
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,500
gonna rename this to wide pad let's

452
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,750
group these two together I'm actually

453
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,280
gonna get rid of the sidechain on each

454
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,350
individual layer and just put it on the

455
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,540
overall group let's add in another pad

456
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,410
just for the sake of making the mix just

457
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,390
a little bit wider

458
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,100
I found this pad that's kind of

459
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:35,130
interesting again under operator pad

460
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:36,630
this time it's called still sky maybe I

461
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,680
want to lower the volume of this just a

462
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,090
little bit but as you can more or less

463
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,040
put together at this point I'm just kind

464
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,050
of adding elements on top of each other

465
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,790
just stacking layers but maybe let's

466
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,830
also add in a different layer maybe I

467
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:54,120
want to add in melody so let's add in a

468
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:56,130
layer of leads I'm picturing my leads to

469
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,650
be something xylophone II so I found

470
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,810
this brushed bail hit spell I guess

471
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,000
under operator mallets let's drag that

472
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,700
on and now let's get to writing on

473
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,290
melody okay so I whipped up melody real

474
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,360
quick here and I'm gonna do the same

475
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,430
thing for what I did with these pad just

476
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,530
more or less stack a lot of layers that

477
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,179
I'm happy with that I kind of want to

478
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,789
work together in

479
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,099
ok so I have a few that I'm happy with i

480
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,009
stacked guitar

481
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:25,229
I guess sitar guitar over here and the

482
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:27,499
FM one short lead and this is what it

483
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:27,499
sounds like

484
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:36,680
[音频]

485
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,830
melodies are another thing I'm chalking

486
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,240
up as more or less something I can't

487
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,950
cover in this video they're kind of a

488
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,100
thing of their own but the one tip I

489
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,690
will give is to stay in key and also

490
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,240
again as I mentioned before with the

491
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,130
chords music theory is important but

492
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,900
also so is rhythm you have to kind of

493
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,000
balance the two I'm gonna group these

494
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,670
together as I did before with everything

495
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,080
else and I'm gonna get to balancing each

496
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:05,270
of these I like how they sound together

497
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,270
but maybe not at their current volumes

498
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,960
I'm gonna throw some audio effects on

499
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,540
our overall group maybe an EQ again

500
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,860
maybe some compressors for the sink of

501
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,720
side-chaining but I'm actually gonna

502
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,070
lessen up on these ones just because

503
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,680
they're the leads and I want them to

504
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,120
kind of lay overtop the whole mix but I

505
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:29,100
still do want a little bit of

506
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:31,620
sidechaining in there maybe I can add in

507
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,480
some reverb maybe some delay of sorts

508
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,010
maybe a glue compressor at the end of it

509
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,010
all to kind of tie everything together

510
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,880
[音频]

511
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,280
and at this point I'm noticing certain

512
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,890
elements or maybe getting drowned out

513
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,910
for example our symbols so it's at this

514
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,500
point where you'd kind of go back and

515
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,870
tinker with everything on just the

516
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,250
volumes again nothing is ever really set

517
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,470
in stone as soon as you make it you're

518
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,960
allowed to go back and adjust things ok

519
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,180
so I just went back and I added another

520
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,100
layer of plucks I adjusted some volumes

521
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:15,630
just a little bit of tweaks here and

522
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:17,640
there so we have a nice loop here and

523
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,790
that's fine and dandy but to turn it

524
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,440
into an actual song we need to extend it

525
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:25,470
maybe actually it has to be a full

526
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:29,400
length song so 3 minutes or so point is

527
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:31,140
that can't really just be 20 seconds so

528
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,730
I'm gonna move this loop right here I'm

529
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,430
just gonna I'm just gonna left click and

530
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,350
drag and I'm gonna copy this and paste

531
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,630
it over here at which point maybe I want

532
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,940
to delete over this as well so now let's

533
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,560
make a transition maybe a quick quick

534
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,540
intro that kind of builds up and plays

535
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,000
into this little loop that we made maybe

536
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,950
I want to copy over the pads for example

537
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,170
I'm just kind of paste them over here

538
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,700
maybe I want them to be able to fade in

539
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,530
one thing I can do unable to ten is

540
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,720
switch to automation mode by pressing a

541
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,820
at which point you'll see a lot of these

542
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,070
red lines appear let's automate the

543
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,080
volume of our overall chords group track

544
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,820
I can do that by left clicking the

545
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,770
volume and you'll notice this red line

546
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,920
appeared I can automate this which means

547
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,810
I can change its value over time and so

548
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,730
maybe I want it to slowly fade in one

549
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,950
thing I can do is left-click and select

550
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,810
an anchor point right here and then

551
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,700
let's set another one at the beginning

552
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,380
now at this point I'm gonna left click

553
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,480
and drag it down and you'll notice that

554
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,400
I've lowered this to negative 10

555
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,050
decibels now if I were to hit play and

556
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,390
watch the volume over here it's

557
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,070
currently changing over time some things

558
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,810
you can do from here are add in some

559
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,940
more breakpoints to adjust the

560
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,220
automation you can hold the Alt key and

561
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,630
that selects this entire line I wish

562
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,340
want you can left-click and drag and

563
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,650
that creates a slope so let's have it

564
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,519
slowly fade in let's do the same thing

565
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,499
with our melody actually

566
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,999
want to copy and paste this over here

567
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,440
except I only want it to come in right

568
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:54,940
about here but I'm gonna do the same

569
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:04,179
thing with the volume I'm gonna automate

570
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:06,669
it another thing that can be potentially

571
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,559
is automate a low-pass filter so let's

572
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:10,029
add a low-pass filter right here maybe I

573
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,519
just want to cut off something really

574
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,649
high like sixteen thousand what I can do

575
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,419
is I can click this knob and automate

576
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:18,009
that as well so if I were to set a

577
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,899
breakpoint right here and then maybe

578
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:22,059
right here I can have it be lower I can

579
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:37,089
essentially have this EQ filter automate

580
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:39,519
over time let's get rid of some of these

581
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:41,469
layers and then finally let's wrap it up

582
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,329
by adding in a transition sound effect

583
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:47,289
let's right click over here and insert

584
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:51,820
audio track let's go over under drums

585
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:54,099
maybe find a ride this one sounds pretty

586
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,139
good to me something long let's drag it

587
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,029
on to our audio track let's double click

588
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:00,729
it and actually hit this button right

589
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:03,269
here this reverses the sample now if I

590
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:03,269
were to hit play

591
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,970
now it's sounding a little bit weird and

592
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,650
that's because it's warped one thing I

593
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,780
also want to do is unclick this button

594
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:24,780
right here it says warp now let's zoom

595
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:26,610
in and drag this right over here and so

596
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,320
now I have a very basic transition sound

597
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,300
effect but I feel like it's coming in

598
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,490
maybe a little too soon so let's drag

599
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,410
this over by left clicking the end over

600
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,630
here dragging it and let's hit the a

601
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,980
button to leave automation mode at which

602
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,290
point when I hover over this sound

603
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,550
effect you'll notice there's four

604
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,040
squares that show up on each corner

605
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,900
let's left-click this one and drag it in

606
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,180
this controls the volume of the sound

607
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:54,720
effect so essentially it's slowly coming

608
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:56,970
in it's fading in over time I can move

609
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:03,300
this little icon right here to change

610
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:05,280
the slope of the line finally let's

611
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,950
right click insert audio track let's add

612
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,230
in one more ride a simple sound effect

613
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,600
at the beginning of this loop so it kind

614
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,880
of rises up into this reverse cymbal but

615
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,230
then it also crashes as soon as this

616
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:22,520
loop starts this sounds good to me let's

617
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:26,470
make sure this isn't warped as well

618
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:29,120
[音频]

619
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:42,080
must maybe lower the volume of this real

620
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:44,330
quick and I think that should do it

621
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,460
that's you know the very basics of

622
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,380
making your first song what you do at

623
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,120
this point is more or less just take

624
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,730
what you just learned and kind of extend

625
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,340
that to make an entire full length track

626
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,260
you'd then also have to export your song

627
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,050
which you can which you can do by going

628
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,190
to file export audio and video and then

629
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,410
you'd also have to make sure that your

630
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,900
track is mastered that's another process

631
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,400
in of itself but there you have it

632
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,380
that's pretty much it that's the basics

633
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,610
of making your first song I hope you

634
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,500
enjoyed the video I hope you learned

635
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,140
something consider checking out my new
